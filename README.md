# OC_Eviction_Watch

Posts notices on Twitter when the OC Sheriff's Department shows they are responding to a call for an Eviction Proceeding

This Twitter bot checks the Orange County Sheriff's Legal Blotter at http://ws.ocsd.org/Blotter/BlotterSearch.aspx for updates showing that they have been dispatched to calls. If new call comes in and is for an Eviction Proceeding, the bot posts a warning Tweet so that concerned people can work to help defend themselves from evictions.

As the federal eviction moratorium comes to an end, the purpose of this bot is additionally to keep people informed of the extent to which the government will be increasing homelessness in this community.
